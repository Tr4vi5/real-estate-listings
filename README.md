- [x] 3 views, 3 angular.js routes, each with a controller and view file.
- [x] Implemented a bootstrap Card UI.

## To-Do List
### Home/Add Listing View/Route

- [x] Create a client-side route, controller, and view file for the home page.
- [x] Allow a user to add a property to the database on this view. You will need to give the user an option for either a Rental property or a Sale property.
- [x] Allow the user to enter the name of one of the images provided to display with the new listing. This only needs to be a text input.


### Rental Property View/Route

- [x] Create a client-side route, controller, and view file for Rental properties.
- [x] Display only those properties that are For Rent.
- [x] Display the listings in "card" elements, including the associated image. Images have been provided for you and assigned to each property.
- [x] Ability to delete an existing listing. Place a `delete` button on each listing card.

### Sale Property View/Route

- [x] Create a client-side route, controller, and view file for Sale properties.
- [x] Display only those properties that are For Sale.
- [x] Display the listings in "card" elements, including the associated image. Images have been provided for you and assigned to each property.
- [x] Ability to delete an existing property. Place a `delete` button on each property card.

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Create a dropdown/select so that the user doesn't need to type `sale` or `rent` for every new listing
- [x] Create a dropdown/select so that the user doesn't need to type the image url for every new listing
- [ ] Display the least expensive property featured prominently at the top of the view
- [ ] Ability to search or filter by various parameters (try doing this using a server side route with a query parameter)
- [ ] Add other images to your application
